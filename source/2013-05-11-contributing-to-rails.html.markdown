Iâ€™ve finally gotten around to putting my recent talk on Triaging Rails Issues on my [speakerdeck](https://speakerdeck.com/thenickcox/triaging-rails-issues) page. The slides are extremely terse, though, and it will probably be easier to follow by watching the video of my talk, embedded here. (Thanks to [Dave Laird](http://kiwiupover.com) for the video!)
