Tonight, my wife and I watched Ang Lee’s exquisite (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190332/?ref_=sr_1]. We had both seen it before, but we had both loved the beauty of the physics defying martial arts, so we decided to watch it again.

I had forgotten how frequently the movie drew the common parallel between calligraphy and swordplay, a theme explored in Jet Li’s (Hero)[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299977/?ref_=sr_4], another exciting, yet gorgeous film.

I was excited when, at the end, I recognized the characters in Ang Lee’s name. READMORE It is shown below.

The characters are 李安. Both are compound characters. The first, 李, is a combination of tree (木) and child (子). I was curious what this meant, and it apparently means (‘plum’)[http://translate.google.com/#zh-CN/en/%E6%9D%8E] on its own. The second character is a combination of roof (宀) and woman (女), creating a compound character meaning peace.

I was excited to recognize these symbols (though I didn't know plum off-hand), and it told me I was making some progress after only such a short time!
